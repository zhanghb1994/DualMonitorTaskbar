	- Feature #3555154: show application title above aero thumbnail preview

*** Version 1.18.042612
	New
	- Feature Request #3521379: 
		Use aero preview delay (HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Advanced\ThumbnailLivePreviewHoverTime)
		Keep preview window active when moving to adjacent app
		Show window title on mouse hover (not quite like the original taskbar, but I think it helps)
	- Feature Request #3518012:
		When pinning application, save command line arguments
		When pinning a TXT file (or other document) by drag & drop, we actually pin Notepad.exe (or default program that opens that document) 
		with the TXT file as argument. So every time you use the pin button to launch the process, you will open notepad with the TXT file.
	- Feature Request #3452511
		Use registry setting HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Advanced\ExtendedUIHoverTime. 
		If this value is higher than 2000, live previews are disabled
